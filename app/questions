1) Explain REST and RESTful
REST : Representational State Transfer, is a software architecture that defines a set of contraints to create web services.
RESTful : (The particularity of this architecture is that the server part and the client part communicate without the client knowing the structure 
and content of the information stored on the server.

2) Explain the architectural style for the creation of a web API (client server communication, formatting language, etc.)
* A simple URl adress for th services
* HTTP for the communication client/server
* Stateless communication
* XML/JSON as formatting language

3) Explain HTTP requests types when used with RESTful web (GET, PUT, POST, etc.)
* GET :retrieves data from the server.
* PUT : used to update an existing entity.
* POST : used for crating an entity or a resourse without an id.

4) Explain the difference between stateless and stateful protocol. Which type of protocol is HTTP ?
Stateless Protocol does not require the server to retain the server information or session details. 
Stateful Protocol require server to save the status and session information.
HTTP is a stateful protocol.

5) Explain the difference between a GET and a POST (like how are sent the parameters)
POST requests supply additional data from the client (browser) to the server in the message body and can send parameters, including uploading files, to the server.
In contrast, GET requests include all required data in the URL but the parameter data is limited to what we can 
stuff into the request line (URL)

6) You canâ€™t work out how to solve a coding problem. What do you do to find the answer?
If I can't work out how to solve a coding problem, I'll try tp simplify it so I can find a manuel solution with the minimum of data.
Then, I can write a simple pseudocode to translate it later to a complete code with exact set of data.
